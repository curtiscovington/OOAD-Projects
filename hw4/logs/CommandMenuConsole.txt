ne graph should show two lines – Item Sales and Total Register $ – for each day of 
the simulation.  Another graph should show three lines – counts of Items in Inventory, Sick Pets, and Items Sold 
– for each day of the simulation.  

Overall Project Guidelines 
Be aware that the class midterm exam will run from noon Saturday 6/25 through the end of the day Thursday 
6/30.  The exam window will be three hours (longer for those with accommodation).  Plan ahead to make sure 
you allocate time for this project work and the midterm.  To help with this, I will waive the normal 5% late 
penalties for the first two days after the due date, but the 15% penalty for the last two days will still be in 
place.
